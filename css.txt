BOX MODEL in CSS--------------------------------------------
Each and every thing inside css is a box...
Margin > border > padding > content

*if you give directly a height of 200px to any element then 200px is taken by its content only but when you set box-sizing = border-box property then 200px is the height in which content padding and border is included....

Concept of Margin Collapse-------in Box MODEL
between two elements which are placed up and down so if 1 has a margin of 25px and the other has margin of 25px then by observation the gap between the two must be 50 px but it will remain 25 px because the gap between the two will be equal to the max of both the margins and applied once...
